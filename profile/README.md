Our products use advanced queryable encryption technology that keeps data encrypted-in-use, rather than just at-rest. This ensures that access controls are always applied and guarantees that every data access is logged.

CipherStash shows you the who, what, where, and when of how sensitive data is accessed — even when it leaves core systems.

CipherStash works in your existing databases, data lakes, and data warehouses via a drop-in driver replacement. An SDK is also available to support more sophisticated use cases.

## 👁 Encryption should be scrutinized

We believe that the only encryption you can trust is **encryption developed in public**.

Check out our encryption libraries:

- [ActiveStash](https://github.com/cipherstash/activestash) is a Rails plugin for doing encrypted search on encrypted ActiveRecord models
- [Envelopers](https://github.com/cipherstash/envelopers) is a very simple envelope encryption library
- [ore.rs](https://github.com/cipherstash/ore.rs) is a Rust implementation of [Order Revealing Encryption](https://cipherstash.com/how-it-works)
