## Building secure applications should be easy

At CipherStash care deeply about data-security and want to make the best possible encryption easy-to-use for all
developers.

We're building a secure data-vault that uses _searchable_ encryption to keep data encrypted at all times: in-transit,
at-rest and *in-use*. We don't want you to have to learn some new esoteric protocol or API. Oh no. We're making
CipherStash work with your favourite languages and tools like Prisma and ActiveRecord.

## Encryption should be Scrutinized

We believe that for you to trust our encryption, we must develop it in public. The best security comes from scrutiny,
not obscurity.
