CipherStash helps you build encryption-enabled apps with blazing fast search.

You can add application-level encryption to your JavaScript apps, Rails apps or Cloudflare Workers with just a few lines of code.

Level up your data security, and keep the dev workflows you know and love.

## 👁 Encryption should be scrutinized

We believe that the only encryption you can trust is **encryption developed in public**.

Check out our encryption libraries:

- [ActiveStash](https://github.com/cipherstash/activestash) is a Rails plugin for doing encrypted search on encrypted ActiveRecord models
- [Envelopers](https://github.com/cipherstash/envelopers) is a very simple envelope encryption library
- [ore.rs](https://github.com/cipherstash/ore.rs) is a Rust implementation of [Order Revealing Encryption](https://cipherstash.com/how-it-works)
