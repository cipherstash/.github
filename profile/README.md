## ✨ We're making it easy to build secure applications

CipherStash helps you build encryption-enabled apps with blazing fast search.

You can add data encryption to your Node.js or Ruby apps with just a few lines of code.

Level up your security, and keep the dev workflows you know and love.

## 👁 Encryption should be scrutinized

We believe that the only encryption you can trust is **encryption developed in public**.

Check out our encryption libraries:

- [ore.rs](https://github.com/cipherstash/ore.rs) is a Rust implementation of [Order Revealing Encryption](https://cipherstash.com/how-it-works)
- [StashJS](https://github.com/cipherstash/stashjs) is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for encrypting and searching data in your Node.js apps

## 🏔️ We're just getting started 

Our mission is to protect the world's data.
