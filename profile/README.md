CipherStash is not encryption just at-rest or in-transit — it's end-to-end, searchable, traceable encryption-in-use.

Apply access control directly to your data with encryption-in-use that works everywhere, from SQL to Spreadsheet.

## 👁 Encryption should be scrutinized

We believe that the only encryption you can trust is **encryption developed in public**.

Check out our encryption libraries:

- [ore.rs](https://github.com/cipherstash/ore.rs) is a Rust implementation of [Order Revealing Encryption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/612.pdf)
- [Envelopers](https://github.com/cipherstash/envelopers) is a simple envelope encryption library

## 🏔️ Our mission is to _protect the digital future_.
