CipherStash Proxy is free to use, and you can and you can add our Audit and Encrypt modules as you need them.

## Encryption should be scrutinized

We believe that the only encryption you can trust is **encryption developed in public**.

Check out our encryption libraries:

- [ore.rs](https://github.com/cipherstash/ore.rs) â€“ a Rust implementation of [Order Revealing Encryption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/612.pdf)
- [envelopers](https://github.com/cipherstash/envelopers) - a simple envelope encryption library

## Because data protection is a team sport.
